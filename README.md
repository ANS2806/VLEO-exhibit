The current version of the simulation serves as an educational game that is designed to explain effects of atomic oxygen particles on satellites in Very Low Earth Orbit. 
This includes loss of altitude, loss of speed due to drag, use of thrusters, attitude determination and control systems, and calculation of delta V needed to manoeuver to original orbit.
