# VLEO-exhibit-project
This project was created as part of my SOE Summer Internship 2024.

The current version of the simulation serves as an educational game that is designed to explain effects of atomic oxygen particles on satellites in Very Low Earth Orbit. 
This includes loss of altitude, loss of speed due to drag, use of thrusters, attitude determination and control systems, and calculation of delta V needed to manoeuver to original orbit.
Project Documentation is also available in this repository along with several useful flowcharts. A YouTube video showing how the project works is available at https://youtu.be/ySsJiKzwlRg
